# CSE1500 Notes
With the .org file the notes can be displayed directly within GitHub in a nicely formatted way (I had no idea this was possible, it's a nice side effect for sure).
The PDF file is the LaTeX version of the .org file.

Feel free to create an issue if there's something wrong with my notes.
